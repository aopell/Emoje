# Emoje - The Emoji Economy
Welcome to Emoje (pronounced *E-MOHJ* like *Doge*) where you can buy and sell emojis in a Steam Marketplace-like setting. Each user starts with e̩̍10000 (Emojecoin) which can be used to purchase looboxes containing emojis of various rarities which can then be bought and sold in either a global market or just between members of a server. Take a look at some of our features below!

## Features

### Loot Boxes

Run `+lootbox open` to purchase and open a loot box, giving you 4 random emojis of random rarities (Blue: Common, Green: Rare, Magenta: Epic, Gold: Legendary). Emoji rarities are dynamically determined by market prices, meaning that emojis that are more valued in the economy are harder to get in lootboxes.

### Markets

### Investments
Invest your Emojecoin in real stocks and cryptocurrencies! The price of a stock or cryptocurrency is determined by the price in US dollars, so you can buy 10 shares of AAPL for e̩̍2000, wait until the price goes up and sell it later for e̩̍2500.

Use `+invest in <stock|cryptocurrency> <symbol> <amount>` to buy stocks or cryptocurrencies:
